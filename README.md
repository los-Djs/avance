## Issue:

We all have some source of light in our house that feels warmn, but have we ever wondered thoy or how? Well, in order to answer this question, we are going yo develop our project with help of radiative transfer.

## Model:

Radiative Transfer, is the physical phenomenon of energy transfer in the form of electromagnetic radiation.
The progragation of radiation through a medium is affected by abosrption, emission, and scattering processes. It's basically how energy interacts with the matter through which this is transfered.


## Goal:
Our goal is to implement the radiative transfer model for a few simple controlled cases succesfully

## Software Tools:

<!-- We have in minf to use these three software tools, if oth -->
Below, we are going to list the software we are going to need:

1. Python
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib

## Data source:

For this proyect, there is no need fore real data, using the initial conditions is enough.
